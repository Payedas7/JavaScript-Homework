In this assignment I have worked on HTML as well as Javascript file.Where I made a link between two ".JS" files , 
    #1) Data.j
    #2) App.js
 -this second file was able to handle the click function of search button and reset button according to requirement also this file is containing the code how the search is getting performed.
 
The first file is containing of actual data that we are displaying in our HTML page. The Data in this file is in a list format, where the list is of several dictionaries. From the Key field of this dictionary we are able to understand the column names and actual table data we are fetching according to the user input in the mentioned input fields via HTML page.


## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)


Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
